                    Homeweb is a secure digital mental health platform developed by Homewood Health, providing 24/7 confidential access to counselling, self-guided wellness tools, iCBT programs, and crisis support.

                    Homeweb is accessible via desktop and mobile apps in both English and French, offering a consistent and secure experience.

        ðŸ”¹ Role & Contributions
        As the technical lead for the front-end team and a key contributor to UX strategy, I played a pivotal role in designing and refining the third and current major version of Homeweb. My contributions included:
        - Leading the front-end development team.
        - Collaborating directly with the Director of Product and Brand Design through the full design lifecycle â€” from wireframes to user flows and stories.
        - Spearheading improvements in:
        - Booking flow and service discovery.
        - Dashboard and navigation.
        - Responsive design and accessibility compliance.
        - Ensuring performance, consistency, and a modern, intuitive UX across mobile and desktop.

        ðŸ”¹ Key Challenges & Considerations
        - Balancing clinical safety and academic tools with accessible, user-friendly UX.
        - Integrating complex services and modalities (e.g., counselling, content, iCBT, assessments) into a cohesive interface.
        - Ensuring compatibility and a seamless experience across browsers, devices, and assistive tech.
        - Working with third-party vendors such as RingCentral while maintaining performance and security.
        - Meeting business needs related to service utilization, cost control, and monetization, without compromising user access to critical supports.

        ðŸ”¹ Impact & Outcomes
        My work led to major improvements in the platformâ€™s reliability, accessibility, and scalability:
        - Platform stability & uptime: Reduced critical errors and improved site reliability.
        - Accessibility: Significant enhancements toward WCAG compliance.
        - CMS tooling: Enabled non-technical contributors to publish and manage content with ease.
        - Service access: Streamlined discovery and booking flows for higher engagement.
        - BI & analytics: Provided better access to usage data, enabling informed product and service decisions.
        - Design consistency: Delivered a unified experience across Homewoodâ€™s product ecosystem.
        - Error handling: Improved messaging and fallback flows across the site.

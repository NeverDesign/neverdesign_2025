				<p>
					The Meticulon Assessment Service (MAS) is a digital platform designed to assess the employment readiness of neurodiverse individuals—particularly those on the autism spectrum—using a strength-based approach. 
					Built in collaboration with Meticulon, a Canadian social enterprise, the MAS platform helps participants, educators, and job coaches evaluate individual skills across 12 employer-informed categories such as perseverance, communication, and teamwork.
				</p>
				<p>
					The platform is used in classrooms, social service agencies, and family contexts to support goal-setting, training, and employment. It is offered as a white-labelable product bundle, enabling client organizations to integrate the service into their own ecosystems or license it to others. Over 40 participants were assessed in the initial deployment phase, with the program now supporting a wider rollout.

		<p class="h3">Role &amp; Contributions</p>
		<p>I led the UX and UI design and implementation for both version 2 and version 3 (the current production version) of the MAS platform. My work spanned early-stage product strategy through to front-end development and partner enablement. Key contributions included:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Collaborating directly with Meticulon stakeholders to define the platform’s scope, functionality, and outcome goals.</li>
			<li>Designing all aspects of the product experience — from wireframes and user flows to high-fidelity visual designs.</li>
			<li>Implementing the web application’s interface with an emphasis on flexibility, accessibility, and performance.</li>
			<li>Supporting staff training and developing user-facing documentation.</li>
			<li>Working closely with back-end developers to:</li>
			<li>Architect the platform for multi-tenant use.</li>
			<li>Enable seamless white labelling, allowing Meticulon to license the software to other organizations.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="h3">Key Challenges &amp; Considerations</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Designing for diverse audiences — including neurodivergent participants, family members, employment coaches, educators, and employers — all with differing accessibility and usability needs.</li>
			<li>Supporting a broad range of devices and input methods, including mobile browsers, desktops, and assistive technologies.</li>
			<li>Ensuring the interface was intuitive, dignified, and strength-based, avoiding clinical or deficit-focused language.</li>
			<li>Creating a UI flexible enough to be easily customized and rebranded by client organizations.</li>
			<li>Implementing a system that maintains user privacy while enabling aggregate tracking and reporting across roles.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="h3">Impact &amp; Outcomes</p>
		<p>My work on the MAS platform directly enabled and influenced all reported program outcomes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>90% of MAS participants continued to employment training or academic pathways.</li>
			<li>Over 50% of employed participants retained long-term positions.</li>
			<li>One-third of participants secured employment within six months of completing the MAS program.</li>
			<li>Created a tool that supports coaches and families in tailoring readiness strategies to individual strengths.</li>
			<li>Enabled Meticulon to expand their impact and commercialize the product as a licensed, white-labeled offering.</li>
		</ul>
